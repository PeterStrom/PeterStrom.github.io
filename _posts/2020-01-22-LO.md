We have finally published our work on AI for prostate cancer diagnostics and grading. For this we digitized specimen from thousands of biopsies. The aims were to:


* Detect cancer in prostate biopsies with high enough accuracy that the AI can be used autonomously.
* Grade cancer at a level that is comparable to experienced uro-pathologists.
* Estimate the overall tumor burden with clinically acceptable precision.


Iâ€™m very happy to see that we achieved all these three goals. We have validated the AI on 2000 images - both internal and external validation. There was a drop in performance on the external data as would be expected, since it came from a new lab and a new scanner, but we are still happy with the performance. The main building blocks are deep convolutional neural nets and gradient boosted trees. Here is the article in Lancet Oncology:
