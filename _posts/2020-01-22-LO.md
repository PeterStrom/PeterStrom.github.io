title: The importance of study design in the application of artificial intelligence methods in medicine

We have finally published our work on AI for prostate cancer diagnostics and grading. For this we digitized specimen from thousands of biopsies. The aims were to:  
<br/><br/>
- Detect cancer in prostate biopsies with high enough accuracy that the AI can be used autonomously.  
<br/><br/>
- Grade cancer at a level that is comparable to experienced uro-pathologists.  
<br/><br/>
- Estimate the overall tumor burden with clinically acceptable precision.  
<br/><br/>
I’m very happy to see that we achieved all these three goals. We have validated the AI on 2000 images - both internal and external validation. There was a drop in performance on the external data as would be expected, since it came from a new lab and a new scanner, but we are still happy with the performance. The main building blocks are deep convolutional neural nets and gradient boosted trees. Here is the article in Lancet Oncology:
