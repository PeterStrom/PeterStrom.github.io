title: The importance of study design in the application of artificial intelligence methods in medicine
---
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
A lot of research is focused on digital pathology, especially for the prostate cancer where there are  almost an endless stream of data. One idea that often pops up is that we should not train the AI to learn to grade the cancer as the pathologists do, but rather make the AI learn the association between what it finds looking at the biopsy and how well it will go for the patient in the future. It is basically a good idea, but unfortunately it can never happen.  
 
The reason for this is that a cancer diagnosis is a destructive experiment. If you find cancer you will treat it. And not only that, but the intensity of the treatment is directly dependent on the pathologists grading - not a great thing of you want to build an algorithm that is independently superior to what the pathologists are doing today. But even if you somehow magically manage to create such an AI, how would you ever evaluate it? I cannot see how you could get ethical approvement to decide treatment of patients based on something else than the current diagnostic system.  
 
This is why we recently published a comment to a study which arguably made a too strong statement when they claimed to have improved prostate cancer grading. It is otherwise a very nice publication which I highly recommend reading.
