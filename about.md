At the time of writing I'm about to finish my PhD studies at Karolinska, Stockholm. 
In the last years I have been focusing on prediction modelling and building an AI for
automatic cancer diagnostics. I have a background in mathematics and love data science 
in general, but particularly prediction modelling.
